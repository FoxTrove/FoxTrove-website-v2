FoxTrove AI Voice Agent
Home Services Offer Strategy
Using the Hormozi Grand Slam Offer Framework
Cold Email Campaign Strategy for 13,000+ HVAC Leads
January 2026
Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive offer strategy for FoxTrove's AI voice agent service targeting home services businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical). Using Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers framework, we've designed a Grand Slam Offer that eliminates risk, maximizes perceived value, and creates urgency for your 13,000+ cold email campaign.

The Core Problem You Solve
Home services businesses miss 27-35% of incoming calls. 85% of callers who reach voicemail hang up and call a competitor. Each missed call represents $500-$2,000 in lost revenue. Missing just 2 calls per week costs businesses $50,000+ annually.

Your Value Proposition in One Sentence
"We guarantee your AI receptionist will capture and book at least 5 new jobs in the first 30 days, or you pay nothing and keep everything we built for you."
The Hormozi Value Equation Applied
Alex Hormozi's Value Equation determines perceived value:
Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort Required)
To maximize value, we INCREASE the top (dream outcome + likelihood) and DECREASE the bottom (time + effort). Here's how we apply this to your offer:


Guarantee Structure Options
Hormozi identifies four types of guarantees. For maximum impact with cold prospects, we recommend a STACKED guarantee combining conditional and unconditional elements:

Option 1: The "5 Jobs or Free" Guarantee (RECOMMENDED)
"If your AI receptionist doesn't capture and help you book at least 5 new service calls in your first 30 days, you pay nothing. Period. Keep the AI agent we built. Keep all the leads captured. You owe us zero dollars."
Why this works: It's specific (5 jobs), time-bound (30 days), and outcome-focused (booked jobs, not just calls answered). Most HVAC jobs average $500-$2,000, so 5 jobs = $2,500-$10,000 in revenue vs. your $2,500 setup fee.

Option 2: The "10X ROI" Guarantee
"Your AI receptionist will generate at least $15,000 in booked revenue within 60 days, or we'll refund 100% of your setup fee AND write you a check for $500 for wasting your time."
Why this works: It's a "better than risk-free" guarantee. The $500 pain payment shows extreme confidence and makes the prospect think "What do I have to lose? They'll PAY ME if it fails."

Option 3: The "Double Your Money Back" Guarantee
"If you don't capture at least 10 missed calls that would have gone to voicemail in your first month, we'll refund your entire setup fee AND match it. That's $5,000 back in your pocket."
Why this works: Focuses on the PAIN (missed calls) rather than the outcome. Easier to prove and track. The double-money-back is psychologically powerful.

Option 4: The "Performance Pay" Model
"Pay $0 upfront. We build your AI receptionist for free. You only pay $50 per qualified lead we capture after hours. No leads = No cost."
Why this works: Complete risk reversal. Aligns your success with theirs. Creates a "what's the catch?" reaction that increases engagement. Higher lifetime value potential.
Pricing Strategy
Based on Hormozi's guidance: "Charge the maximum the market can bear while still delivering 10X the value."

Value Anchor Comparison


Recommended Pricing Structure
Setup Fee: $2,500 (one-time) - covers custom configuration, training, and integration
Monthly Retainer: $297-$497/month - includes up to 500 minutes, calendar integration, CRM sync
Overage: $0.25/minute after included minutes

Price Justification for Sales Conversations
"At $297/month, you're paying less than $10/day for 24/7 professional call coverage. One captured emergency call at 2 AM pays for 3 months of service. And remember - we guarantee results or you pay nothing."
The Grand Slam Offer Stack
According to Hormozi, stacking value components makes the offer irresistible. Each element should solve a problem before, during, or after the main solution.

Core Offer: AI Voice Agent
24/7 intelligent call answering in your company name
Emergency call triage and escalation
Direct calendar booking integration
Lead qualification and capture
Spam filtering (blocks up to 47% of junk calls)
Professional voicemail transcription

Bonus 1: "Missed Call Audit" (Value: $497 - FREE)
Before we set anything up, we analyze your current call patterns and show you exactly how much revenue you're losing. This creates urgency and builds trust.

Bonus 2: "Speed to Lead" SMS System (Value: $197/mo - INCLUDED)
Instant text message to prospects when they call after hours: "Thanks for calling [Company]. We got your call and will reach back within 30 minutes." Keeps leads warm while you sleep.

Bonus 3: "72-Hour Launch" Setup (Value: $500 - FREE)
Most competitors take 2-4 weeks. We go live in 72 hours or less. Includes custom voice training, script development, and full integration with your existing systems.

Bonus 4: "Emergency Escalation Protocol" (Value: $297 - FREE)
For true emergencies (burst pipes, no heat in winter, etc.), the AI immediately calls/texts you AND the customer with estimated response time. Never lose an emergency job again.

Bonus 5: Monthly Analytics Dashboard (Value: $97/mo - INCLUDED)
Track calls answered, leads captured, appointments booked, and estimated revenue generated. See exactly what your AI receptionist is doing for you.
Cold Email Campaign Strategy
With 13,000+ HVAC leads ready, here's how to structure your outreach for maximum response rates:

Subject Line Options (Test These)
"How many calls did you miss last night?"
"The $900 voicemail problem"
"Stop losing $50K/year to voicemail"
"Your competitor answered at 2AM. Did you?"
"5 jobs guaranteed or it's free"

Email Framework (Pain → Agitation → Solution → CTA)
Email 1: The Problem (Day 1)
Subject: How many calls did you miss last night?

Quick question: what happens when someone calls about a broken AC at 10pm?

If the answer is "voicemail," you should know that 85% of those callers hang up and call your competitor instead.

At $900+ per service call, that's real money walking out the door.

Would it help if I showed you exactly how many calls you're missing and how much it's costing you? (Takes 5 minutes and it's free.)

Email 2: The Guarantee (Day 3)
Subject: 5 jobs guaranteed (or you pay nothing)

I help HVAC companies capture every call 24/7 with an AI receptionist that sounds human and books appointments directly to your calendar.

Here's my guarantee: If we don't help you book at least 5 new service calls in your first 30 days, you pay nothing. Keep the AI agent. Keep all the leads. Zero dollars.

Most of our clients see ROI in the first week.

Email 3: Social Proof (Day 5)
Subject: How [Similar Company] captured $12K in one month

[Name] from [City] was skeptical too.

He'd been using voicemail for years. "Nobody leaves messages anyway," he said.

But when I showed him he was missing 8+ calls per week during peak season, he agreed to try our AI receptionist.

First month: 34 calls captured. 12 emergency jobs booked. $12,400 in revenue he would have lost.

His words: "I had no idea how much money was slipping through."

Common Objections & Responses

"I already have an answering service"
Response: "Most answering services charge $1-2 per minute and don't know HVAC terminology. They take messages - they don't book jobs. Our AI understands HVAC, books directly to your calendar, and costs a fraction of what you're paying now. Plus, we guarantee results or you pay nothing. What's your current service guaranteeing you?"

"AI doesn't work for my customers"
Response: "I hear that a lot. But here's the thing - 78% of callers can't tell it's AI. And when the alternative is voicemail at 2AM, customers prefer getting help. Would you rather lose the call to voicemail or have an AI capture the lead and text you immediately? We can also set it up to transfer to you for emergencies."

"I need to think about it"
Response: "Totally understand. While you're thinking, how many calls do you estimate you'll miss this week? At $900 average, even 2 missed calls is $1,800 gone. Our setup takes 72 hours and we guarantee results. What specifically would help you make this decision?"

"It's too expensive"
Response: "I get it. Let's do the math together. You're paying $X per month. One emergency call at 2AM = $1,200+. One call pays for 4 months of service. And if we don't get you at least 5 booked jobs in 30 days, it's free. Where's the risk for you?"

"What if customers don't like it?"
Response: "Great question. We customize the voice and personality to match your brand. It sounds like a friendly receptionist, not a robot. And for customers who really want a human, the AI can immediately transfer to you or take a message. No one gets stuck talking to a machine if they don't want to."
