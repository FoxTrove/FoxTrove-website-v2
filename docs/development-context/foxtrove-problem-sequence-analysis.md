# FoxTrove Problem Sequence Analysis
## Hormozi-Style Problem Breakdown for AI Service Offers
*January 2026*

---

# The Framework

Alex Hormozi's insight: **Every problem solved creates a new problem.**

The sequence typically flows:
1. **Awareness Problem** → "I don't know I have this problem"
2. **Understanding Problem** → "I don't know how bad it is"
3. **Resource Problem** → "I don't have what I need to fix it"
4. **Implementation Problem** → "I can't execute the solution"
5. **Optimization Problem** → "It's working but not perfectly"
6. **Scale Problem** → "I need this to work at 10x volume"

**Strategic Insight**: Free offers solve problems 1-2 (awareness/understanding). Paid offers solve problems 3-6 (resources through scale).
