# IMPL-PLAN: Home Services (Voice Agent) Deep Dive
*Goal: The "No-Brainer" Utility Offer.*

## 1. Aesthetic Direction ("Industrial Tech")
*   **Palette**: Dark Navy (`#0B1120`), Electric Blue (`#3B82F6`) for trust/tech, and White/Silver.
*   **Vibe**: "Clean, Reliable, Always On." Think operational dashboards, not luxury hotels.
*   **Typography**: `IBM Plex Sans` (Technical/Legible) for everything.

## 2. The Structure (The Sales Letter)
### A. The Hook ("The Bleeding Neck")
*   **Headline**: "Your Competitors Answer The Phone at 2 AM. Do You?"
*   **Subhead**: "The average HVAC company loses $50k/year to missed calls. Stop the bleeding."

### B. The Mechanism ("The AI Dispatcher")
*   **Concept**: It's not a "bot". It's a **Digital Dispatcher**.
*   **Features**:
    1.  **Instant Answer**: "0 ring delay. 24/7/365."
    2.  **Smart Qualification**: "Asks the right questions (Zip code, Issue type)."
    3.  **Direct Booking**: "Puts the job on your ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro calendar."

### C. The Audio Demo ("The Proof")
*   **Critical Element**: An interactive section to "Hear A Sample Call". (We will use a placeholder or stylized audio visualizer).
*   **Why**: Seeing is believing. Hearing is selling.

### D. The Grand Slam Offer ("The Pilot Partner")
*   **Headline**: "We Build Your Custom Agent For Free ($3,000 Waived)."
*   **The Deal**:
    *   We build it custom (Script + Integration).
    *   You try it for 14 days.
    *   **If it works**: You pay the monthly ($297/mo).
    *   **If it fails**: You pay $0. We shake hands.

### E. The Math (ROI Calculator)
*   **Calculation**: "1 Missed Job = $400. 10 Missed Jobs/mo = $4,000/mo. Our Cost = $297/mo."
*   **Conclusion**: "It pays for itself in one call."
