# The "Specialist Firm" Strategy (Corrected)
*Status: No Fluff. Pure Competence.*

## The Core Correction
**User Feedback**: "RevenueOS is made up. We don't have a single system."
**The Pivot**: **Authority comes from Specificity, not Branding.**
We don't need a fake name. We need to communicate that generic AI agencies fail because they don't understand *Construction* or *Plumbing*. We do.

## The Unifying Theme: "Deep Specialization"
The reason we are the "Top AI Integration Business" is because we don't sell "AI Tools." We sell **Industry-Specific Solutions**.
*   **The Argument**: "Generic AI is a toy. Specialized AI is a weapon. We only build for three sectors because we know exactly how they make money."

## The New Homepage Structure: "The Holding Company"
We keep the "Holding Company" vibe but replace the fake product with **Sector Expertise**.

*   **Headline**: "We Build AI That Actually Works For Three Industries."
*   **Subhead**: "Most AI agencies are guessing. We have deep operational expertise in Field Services, Clinical Aesthetics, and Construction."
*   **The "Choose Your Path" Section**:
    *   **Sector 1: Home Services**. "Dispatch & Booking Agents." (The problem: Missed Calls).
    *   **Sector 2: Med Spas**. "Patient Reactivation Systems." (The problem: Empty Chairs).
    *   **Sector 3: Construction**. "Bid Follow-Up & Back-Office." (The problem: Chaos).

## The Logic (Why this isn't scattered)
It's not scattered if you frame it as **"We are the go-to experts for X, Y, and Z."**
It's scattered if you just say "We do AI for everyone."
By limiting it to *exactly* these three, it shows discipline. "We don't do E-commerce. We don't do Law Firms. We do *these three*."

## Vertical Page Refinement (The Offers Remain)
The offers we developed (Pilot, Reactivation, Bid Recovery) are still strong because they are **specific**.
*   **Home Services**: The "Zero-Risk Pilot" works because it addresses the fear of "Does it work for MY accent/town?"
*   **Med Spa**: "Fill 5 Chairs" works because it results-based.
*   **Construction**: "Recover Ghosted Bids" works because it's a specific pain point.
