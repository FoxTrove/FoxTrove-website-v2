# IMPL-PLAN: Elite Tier Deep Dive
*Goal: Create the "Perfect" High-Ticket Page.*

## 1. Aesthetic Direction ("The Black Card")
*   **Background**: Deep hex black (`#050505`), not standard black.
*   **Accents**: Metallic Gold (`#D4AF37`) used *sparingly* for key text and borders.
*   **Typography**: `Playfair Display` for headlines (Elegant), `IBM Plex Sans` for body (Clean/Industrial).
*   **Vibe**: "Private Equity Firm" meets "Apple Pro". Minimal, spacious, heavy.

## 2. The Structure (Sections)
### A. The Hero ("The Filter")
*   **Headline**: "We Build The Revenue Engines That Power The Top 1%."
*   **Subhead**: "Implementation. Optimization. Scale. This is not a marketing agency."
*   **CTA**: "See If You Qualify" (Button: Gold Outline).

### B. The Problem ("The Ceiling")
*   **Copy**: "You are stuck at $2M-$5M because you are still running operations like a small business. You don't need more leads. You need infrastructure."

### C. The Mechanism ("The AI Engine")
*   **Headline**: "We Install An Automated Workforce."
*   **The How**:
    1.  **Voice**: "Agents that sound human and book jobs 24/7."
    2.  **Logic**: "Reactivation systems that mine your database for lost revenue."
    3.  **Operations**: "Back-office bots that chase bids and schedule crews."
*   **Visual**: Concrete breakdown of "Input (Lead) -> AI Processing -> Output (Revenue)".

### D. The Grand Slam Offer ("The Capital Guarantee")
*   **Headline**: "We Add $300k to Your Baseline in 12 Months."
*   **Risk Reversal**: "Or We Refund You + You Keep The IP."
*   **Subtext**: "The only reason we offer this is because we don't bet on luck. We bet on math."

### E. The Gate (Footer)
*   **Final CTA**: "We work with 5 partners per year. Applying requires a $100M mindset."
