**THE OPPORTUNITY**

**$150,000+**

Average annual revenue lost per med spa to no-shows and poor rebooking

January 2026

# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document outlines the complete go-to-market strategy for FoxTrove's med spa vertical, including the Patient Revenue Recovery System offer, lead magnet strategy, pricing, guarantees, and sales sequences.

| THE CORE PROBLEM Med spas are hemorrhaging revenue from three interconnected leaks: 22% average no-show/cancellation rate ($308K+ lost annually), only 35% rebooking rate (leaving 65% of patients to drift away), and slow lead response that kills after-hours conversions. Combined, the average med spa loses $150,000+ per year to these preventable problems. |
| :---- |

| THE SOLUTION The Patient Revenue Recovery System plugs all three leaks with AI-powered automation: rebooking sequences that increase return visits by 30-50%, no-show prevention that cuts missed appointments in half, and 24/7 lead response that captures every inquiry. One system, all revenue recovered. |
| :---- |

| THE OFFER Founder's Rate (First 10 Clients): $2,500 setup \+ $297/month (50% off standard pricing, locked in for life). Includes complete system implementation, all four core components, and the $10K Revenue Recovery Guarantee. If clients don't recover at least $10,000 in 90 days, full refund. |
| :---- |

## **Key Market Statistics**

| Metric | Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Average no-show/cancellation rate | 22.25% of all bookings |
| Cost per missed appointment | $196 average |
| Annual loss to no-shows | $150,000+ per med spa |
| Average rebooking rate | 20-50% (top performers: 60-80%) |
| Retention impact on profit | 5% increase \= 25-95% profit boost |
| Speed-to-lead conversion | 5-minute response \= 100x more likely to convert |

# **THE PROBLEM JOURNEY**

Understanding the med spa owner's pain points and awareness journey is critical for effective messaging and offer positioning.

## **The Three Revenue Killers (Ranked by Impact)**

### **\#1: THE REBOOKING GAP (Biggest Opportunity)**

* Most med spas only rebook 20-50% of patients  
* Top performers achieve 60-80% rebooking rates  
* **That's a 30-60 percentage point gap in retention**  
* 5% retention increase \= 25-95% profit boost  
* Repeat clients spend 67% more than new ones  
* Acquiring new patient costs 5x more than retaining

### **\#2: THE NO-SHOW DRAIN**

* 22.25% average cancellation rate  
* $196 average cost per missed appointment  
* **$150,000+ annually lost to empty slots**  
* 14% daily revenue loss without systems  
* Automated reminders can reduce no-shows by 30-50%

### **\#3: THE LEAD RESPONSE LAG**

* **Responding in 5 minutes \= 100x more likely to convert**  
* After-hours inquiries go cold overnight  
* 61% skip appointments because scheduling was too hard  
* Front desk overwhelmed (40% cite staff shortages)

## **Customer Awareness Journey**

| Stage | Customer Mindset |
| :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Unaware** | "Business is okay, but we could do better" |
| **2\. Problem Aware** | "Our schedule has gaps... patients aren't coming back" |
| **3\. Solution Aware** | "We need better systems for retention/no-shows" |
| **4\. Product Aware** | "What tools/services can solve this?" |
| **5\. Most Aware** | "FoxTrove can help us recover lost revenue" |

# **THE HORMOZI VALUE EQUATION**

Applying Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers framework to maximize perceived value and conversion.

| THE VALUE EQUATION Value \= (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort Required)To maximize value: Increase the top of the equation (dream outcome and likelihood), decrease the bottom (time and effort). |
| :---- |

| Variable | How We Maximize It | Score |
| :---- | :---- | ----- |
| **Dream Outcome** | Recover $75,000-$150,000/year in lost revenue. Direct profit impact. | **10/10** |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | $10K guarantee removes risk. Automation \= reliable. Proven systems. | **9/10** |
| **Time Delay** | Live in 2 weeks, measurable results in 30-90 days. | **8/10** |
| **Effort Required** | Done-for-you setup, runs on autopilot. Minimal client involvement. | **9/10** |

**Result: Extremely High Perceived Value**

# **THE GUARANTEE**

## **$10K Revenue Recovery Guarantee**

| THE GUARANTEE *"If you don't recover at least $10,000 in revenue from improved rebooking and reduced no-shows in your first 90 days, we'll refund every penny. No questions asked."* |
| :---: |

### **Why This Guarantee Works**

* **Specific dollar amount** \- tangible and believable  
* **Ties directly to the pain** \- revenue leakage  
* **Easy to measure** \- reduced no-shows \+ increased rebooking \= recovered revenue  
* **Conservative target** \- $10K in 90 days is achievable when losing $150K/year  
* **Creates confidence** \- you're betting on your own system

### **Why It's Safe for You**

* Average med spa appointment: $536  
* If we help them rebook just 19 extra patients in 90 days \= $10,184  
* That's roughly 6 extra rebookings per month  
* **With automation, this is highly achievable**

9. "Founder's Rate: 10 spots only"

## **Email 1: Problem Awareness**

**Subject:** "22% of your bookings just... disappear"

| Hi {{firstName}}, Quick stat that might sting a little: The average med spa has a 22% cancellation/no-show rate. At $450/appointment, that's $308,000/year walking out the door. Then there's rebooking. Most med spas only get 35% of patients to schedule their next appointment before leaving. That's another $200K+ in patients who "meant to come back" but never did. Combined? Over half a million in revenue leakage. Every year. We built a system that plugs both leaks automatically—no extra staff, no manual follow-ups. Would a 15-minute call to see your specific numbers be worth it? {{signature}} *P.S. We're offering 50% off our first 10 med spa clients. Only {{spots\_remaining}} spots left.* |
| :---- |

## **Email 2: Solution \+ Guarantee**

**Subject:** "Recover $10K or pay nothing"

| Hi {{firstName}}, Following up on that revenue leakage email. Here's what we're offering our first 10 med spa clients: ✅ AI rebooking engine (automated follow-ups for every treatment type) ✅ No-show prevention (multi-channel reminders that actually work) ✅ 24/7 lead response (never miss another after-hours inquiry) ✅ Revenue dashboard (see exactly what you're recovering) The guarantee: If you don't recover at least $10,000 in the first 90 days, you get a full refund. No questions. Founder's Rate: 50% off everything—$2,500 setup \+ $297/month. This rate is locked in for life for our first 10 clients. Worth a quick call? {{calendly\_link}} |
| :---- |

## **Email 3: Social Proof**

**Subject:** "How one med spa recovered $140K"

| Hi {{firstName}}, Quick case study: A Chicago med spa was struggling with: • 28% no-show rate • 32% rebooking rate • $180K+ annual revenue leakage After implementing automated rebooking sequences and smart reminder systems: • No-show rate dropped to 8% • Rebooking rate jumped to 67% • Revenue recovered: $140,000+ in Year 1 They didn't hire anyone. They just installed the right systems. We're doing the same thing for 10 med spas at our Founder's Rate (50% off, locked in for life). {{spots\_remaining}} spots left. {{calendly\_link}} |
| :---- |

## **Email 4: Urgency**

**Subject:** "{{spots\_remaining}} spots left at Founder's Rate"

*Focus: Last email warning, scarcity messaging, price increase reminder, guarantee reminder, direct booking link.*

## **Email 5: Final Push**

**Subject:** "Closing Founder's Rate tomorrow"

*Focus: Final notice, complete offer summary, guarantee reminder, price doubles after deadline, direct booking link.*

# **OBJECTION HANDLERS**

### **"We already have a booking system / EMR"**

"Great—we integrate with most systems. This isn't a replacement; it's an add-on that automates the follow-up and rebooking that your current system doesn't do. Think of it as the engagement layer that keeps patients coming back. What EMR are you using?"

### **"Our front desk handles rebooking"**

"I hear that a lot. The challenge is consistency—when they're checking someone out, answering the phone, and handling walk-ins, rebooking becomes an afterthought. That's why the industry average is only 35%. Our system sends personalized follow-ups automatically, so your front desk can focus on the in-person experience. What would you estimate your current rebooking rate is?"

### **"We don't have a no-show problem"**

"That's rare—most med spas run 20-25%. What systems do you have in place? Even if you're at 10%, that's still $50K+ in lost revenue annually. And the rebooking side is usually where the bigger leak is. Would it be worth a quick call to see the full picture?"

### **"AI won't work for our patients—they want human touch"**

"Totally understand. The AI handles the behind-the-scenes work—reminders, follow-ups, after-hours inquiries. Your team still delivers the in-person experience. Patients actually appreciate the consistent communication; 97% say they're more likely to rebook when they receive personalized follow-ups. The AI just makes sure those follow-ups happen every single time."

### **"We tried automation before and it didn't work"**

"What happened? Usually it's one of two things: generic messaging that felt spammy, or the system required too much manual work to maintain. We pre-build everything—treatment-specific sequences, proven templates, done-for-you setup. And if it doesn't work, you're covered by our $10K recovery guarantee. What would make you comfortable trying again?"

### **"It's too expensive"**

"Fair concern. Let's do the math: if you're losing even 15% of appointments to no-shows, that's roughly $70K/year. If we recover half of that, you're up $35K—on a $6K investment. That's nearly 6x ROI in Year 1\. And at the Founder's Rate, your monthly is locked at $297—less than one Botox appointment. The real question is: can you afford NOT to fix the leak?"

### **"I need to think about it"**

"Of course. What specifically would help you decide? While you're thinking, your med spa is losing roughly $400-500/day to no-shows and poor rebooking. That's $12-15K/month. If you wait 30 days to decide, that's another $12K gone—and you'd miss the Founder's Rate. What would it take to move forward today?"

### **"Can you show me results first?"**

"That's exactly what the $10K guarantee is for. If we don't help you recover at least $10,000 in 90 days, you get every penny back. You're essentially testing us with zero risk. What would you need to see in those 90 days to know it's working?"

# **DISCOVERY CALL FRAMEWORK**

## **Opening (2 minutes)**

| *"Thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy running a practice. Quick agenda: I'll ask a few questions about your current setup, share what we're seeing work for other med spas, and if it makes sense, I'll show you exactly how our system could work for you. Sound good?"* |
| :---- |

## **Discovery Questions (8 minutes)**

10. "Walk me through what happens after a patient finishes their treatment. How does rebooking work?"  
11. "What would you estimate your rebooking rate is—the percentage who book their next appointment before leaving?"  
12. "What about no-shows? What's your cancellation/no-show rate, roughly?"  
13. "When someone no-shows, what happens? Do they get a follow-up?"  
14. "How do you handle after-hours inquiries—calls and messages that come in at night or on weekends?"  
15. "If I told you the average med spa loses $150K+ a year to no-shows and poor rebooking, would that surprise you?"

## **Pain Amplification (3 minutes)**

| *"So let me make sure I understand. You're at roughly \[X\]% rebooking and \[Y\]% no-shows. At your average appointment value of \[$Z\], that's about \[$XXX,XXX\] annually in revenue leakage. Does that number feel right?"* |
| :---- |

## **Solution Presentation (5 minutes)**

Walk through the four core components, connecting each to their specific pain points. End with:

| *"The result: no-shows drop to under 10%, rebooking jumps to 60-70%, and you recover a significant chunk of that \[$XXX,XXX\]."* |
| :---- |

## **Offer \+ Close (5 minutes)**

| *"Normally this is $5,000 setup plus $597/month. But we're launching with 10 Founder's Rate clients—50% off everything, locked in for life. $2,500 setup, $297/month.* *And here's the guarantee: if you don't recover at least $10,000 in 90 days, full refund.* *We have \[X\] spots left. If this makes sense for you, I can get you started today and have your system live in two weeks. What questions do you have?"* |
