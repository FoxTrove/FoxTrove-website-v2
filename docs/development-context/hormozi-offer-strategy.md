# Hormozi Offer Strategy & "Grand Slam" Guarantees
*Phase 4: Vertical Specific Refinement & Lead Magnets*

## 1. Home Services: The "Pilot Partner" (Volume Play)
*User Direction: Waive $3k setup -> Results -> Monthly Subscription.*

**The Offer**: "The Zero-Risk Pilot"
*   **The Hook**: "We build your custom AI Agent ($3,000 value) for **$0**."
*   **The Commitment**: "You only pay the monthly subscription ($297/mo) *after* the 14-day trial, and ONLY if you are happy with the results."
*   **Why it wins**: It removes the biggest barrier (Setup Fee). It's a pure performance bet.
*   **Grand Slam Element**: "If you don't like it after 14 days, you owe us nothing. We strip the code, and you go back to normal. No harm, no foul."

## 2. Med Spas: The "Customer Journey" Strategy (Value First)
*User Direction: Solve a specific problem for free first (Lead Magnet), then upsell the Core Offer.*

**The Problem Sequence**:
1.  **Awareness**: "I have empty appointment slots." (No-Shows / Low Rebooking).
2.  **Solution**: Fill them.

**The Free Entry Point**: "**The 'Empty Chair' Reactivation Campaign**"
*   **The Offer**: "Give us a list of 50 past clients who haven't booked in 6 months. Our AI will text them a reactivation offer for free."
*   **The Promise**: "We will fill 5-10 appointments for you this week at no cost."
*   **The Bridge**: "Once you see the money appear in your bank account from these texts, we'll talk about installing the full system."

**The Core Offer**: "The Patient Retention Engine"
*   **Upsell**: "You loved the reactivation? Let's install the 24/7 Booking Agent to handle *new* leads too."

## 3. Construction: The "Pragmatic" Approach (High Ticket)
*User Direction: No "Installation" (too techy/confusing). Needs to be practical/pragmatic. Need a free entry.*

**Renaming the Solution**:
*   *Avoid*: "Installation", "RevenueOS".
*   *Use*: **"The 24/7 Digital Project Manager"** or **"Automated Back-Office System"**.
    *   *Concept*: It's like hiring a rockstar employee who never sleeps.

**The Free Entry Point**: "**The 'Ghosted Bid' Recovery**"
*   **The Problem**: GCs send estimates and never follow up because they are busy on job sites.
*   **The Offer**: "We will automate the follow-up for your last 10 'ghosted' bids."
*   **The Value**: "We usually recover 1-2 jobs just by following up. We'll do this small batch for free to prove it works."

**The Core Offer**: "**The Ironclad Operating System**"
*   **Promise**: "We automate the boring stuff. Qualifying leads, chasing bids, scheduling subs. You build; the system runs the office."
*   **Guarantee**: "We find $50k in lost opportunities in 30 days, or we pay you."
