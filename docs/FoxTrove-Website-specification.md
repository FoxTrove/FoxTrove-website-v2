FoxTrove.ai
Complete Website Rebuild Specification
For: Antigravity Development Team
Date: January 6, 2026
1. Executive Summary
This document provides complete specifications for rebuilding FoxTrove.ai from the ground up. The current site positions FoxTrove as a generic enterprise automation consultancy with fabricated credentials. This complete mismatch with our actual business is actively hurting lead generation and conversion.
What's Changing
FROM:
Generic 'business process automation' positioning
False Fortune 500 credentials
No specific verticals or offerings
Enterprise consulting language
Hidden pricing
TO:
Clear vertical focus: Home Services, Med Spas, Construction
Honest positioning: Solo AI expert specializing in voice agents
Specific, productized offerings with transparent pricing
Pain-focused messaging that speaks directly to target customers
Elite tier ($100K+) positioned prominently
Why This Matters
Our current site attracts the wrong leads and repels the right ones. HVAC contractors, med spa owners, and construction GCs land on the site and think 'this isn't for me.' Meanwhile, we get inquiries from enterprise buyers expecting Fortune 500-level resources we don't have.
The new site will speak directly to service business owners experiencing acute pain around missed calls, no-shows, and operational chaos. Every page will have clear CTAs, transparent pricing, and messaging that matches their actual problems.
